So it creates a student with the attributes inside the student table, however
, in order for the view all students to work there needs to be a some way to 
register the student for the current year, not to mention the parent needs to
exist for the student to be registered so im not too sure how to handle that
part. Also lol the register student view needs to change since in the DB
there needs to be Student Type, so the admin needs to select Registered each
time, and posibly the atribute First_Name should change along with Last_Name
in the Parent table since that is the same as the Student attributes.

Now lets talk about the staff controller...uhh the staff table *cries inside*
,so we want to add a new staff member, that involves, teacher, admin and HOD
buut there is no "User_Type" in the admin, teacher and hod tables so
it will never be knonw that this is a teacher etc, since i will more than
likely need a view model for this controller...:'( ill probably solicit
